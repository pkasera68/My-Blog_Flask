if we want to generate an email to the user by which he can reset his password , by generating a secure
time sensitive token which ensures that only the person having access to that email can reset it
within a specific time,
then we need to use a package called itsdangerous.
See the below imports and try them on interpreter:

from itsdangerous import TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer as Serializer
 s= Serializer('secret',30)
 Serializer can be siad as a machine to create the token.
 here 30 is the no of seconds till which the token or message will be valid.

 setting the token, token is nothing but a time sensitive variable which will expire when its time gets over.
 token = s.dumps({'user_id':1}).decode('utf-8')

 to see encoded output of token use
 token

 to see actual value to token use:
 s.loads(token)
 it will show token's payload only if it is valid, error otherwise.
